git add package.json
git commit -m "fix dependency versions for next 15"
git push

### Why this happened
The "Latest" version of Next.js (v15) was released very recently. It made some big changes:
1.  It uses **ESLint 9** (which has a new configuration format).
2.  It uses **React 19** (which is technically still in "Release Candidate" phase but required for Next 15).

By updating your `package.json` to match these new standards, the conflict stops, and Vercel can install everything smoothly.
